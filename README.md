I found this article interesting because the author proposes a better way of writing tests. Unit tests are necessary but they are not economic and convenient. Besides, unit tests usually cover the extreme cases where users seldom encounter. A better way is writing integration tests.

[Xuanzheng Lin] I love the perspective the author offers about unit test. He ackowledges the necessity of unit test but provides a more economic approach to get things down!
